# Let's begin

# What is programming?
# Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer.

# Humans give instructions to a computer using programming languages,
# and the computer executes (runs) those instructions.

# Programming converts human ideas or commands into instructions
# that a computer can understand.

# There are many programming languages such as:
# Python, Java, C++, and Assembly Language.

# Some programming languages are called "low-level" languages.
# Example: Assembly Language
# They are closer to machine language,
# harder for humans to understand, but faster and more direct for computers.

# Some programming languages are called "high-level" languages.
# Example: Python
# They are easier for humans to read and write,
# but need to be translated before the computer can understand them.

# Where do we write our programs?
# We write programs using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
# An IDE helps us write, run, and debug our code more easily.

# In Python, the symbol # is used for comments.
# Comments are ignored by the computer and are meant for humans to read.
