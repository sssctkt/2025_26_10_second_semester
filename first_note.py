#let's begin
#what is programming? Programming is more like a platform between
#human and computer

#human gives instruction to computer in the form of programming, and computer
#will execute the instruction

#what does programming-->change from human command to computer instruction

#we have many many programming language--java, C++, assembly language, python

#some programming languages are called "low level" programming language
#example-->assembly language
#harder to understand by human, but easier to be understood by computer

#some programming languages are called "high level" programming language
#example-->python
#needs more translation so computer can understand it, but easier to be understood
#from human

#next part
#where do we write our program on?
#we write it on IDE--integrated development environment
#it helps your programming experience to be much smoother

# # is a speical comment, it tells the computer that this is a comment
# and disregard it
